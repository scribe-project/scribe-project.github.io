# Web pages for the SCRIBE project
The main file is `index.html`. This file should not be modified. In order to modify content, refer to the following files:
* `partners.html`
* `data.html`
* `publications.html`
* `news.html`

The files are in HTML format until I find a way to import Markdown files.

The file `index.md` is not used any longer, but I keep it for when I find a way to import Markdown.
