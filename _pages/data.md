# Open Data
The project has a strong focus on releasing open access linguistic resources for the Norwegian language. This will be mainly achieved through the [Norwegian Language Bank (Spr√•kbanken)](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/en/sprakbanken/). In this page we will collect links to the main corpora developed during the project.
* [The Norwegian Parliamentary Speech Corpus](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/en/resource-catalogue/oai-nb-no-sbr-58/) (NPSC) consists of 140 hours of audio files and corresponding manual transcriptions of meetings at Stortinget (the Norwegian parliament) from 2017 and 2018. The NPSC is primarily intended as an open-source dataset for ASR development.
* [ONOMASTICA](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/en/resource-catalogue/oai-nb-no-sbr-67-2/) is a pronunciation lexicon for Norwegian names created by Telenor in the 90ies. This version is converted to csv with utf-8 encoding.
* [N-grams from NB Digital](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/en/resource-catalogue/oai-nb-no-sbr-70/) contains unigrams, bigrams and trigrams extracted from the digitized texts at the National Library of Norway. This resource can be used for language modelling.
