# Web pages for the SCRIBE project

The pages are automatically generated from Markdown and data files that you can find in this repository. Please look at the existing data as an example of how to add new information.

The main data files are under `_data`:
- `publist.yml`: to add publications to the list. If you add pictures from the publications, these have to be saved in `images/pubpic`
- `team_members.yml`, `students.yml`, `international_members.yml`, `alumni*`: to add members to the project that will appear under Team. The corresponding pictures have to be saved in `images/teampic`
- Logotypes: are stored under `images/logopic`
- If you want to change the content of any web page, use the Markdown files unders `_pages`.
