  description: The Norwegian Parliamentary Speech Corpus (NPSC) is the first, publicly available dataset containing unscripted, Norwegian speech designed for training of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. The NPSC-trained system performed significantly better, with a 22.9% relative improvement in word error rate (WER) and a "democratizing" effect in terms of dialects.
