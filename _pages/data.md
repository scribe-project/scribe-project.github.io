# Open Data
The project has a strong focus on releasing open access linguistic resources for the Norwegian language. This will be mainly achieved through the [Norwegian Language Bank (Spr√•kbanken)](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/en/sprakbanken/). In this page we will collect links to the main corpora developed during the project.
