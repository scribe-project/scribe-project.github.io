# Objectives

SCRIBE's primary objective is to develop a Norwegian speech-to-text transcription system for multi-party conversations in realistic recording
conditions.

In order to attain the project goal, research and technology development beyond the state-of-the-art is needed within several key areas. These include language universal issues, as well as issues specifically related to the Norwegian language.

## Secondary objectives:
* We will develop models that are robust to disfluencies that are typical in spontaneous conversational speech, that
can cope with turn taking and take advantage of the context in the dialog.
* The models will also support the use of spoken dialects and different orthographies (Bokmål, Nynorsk, or dialect
specific).
* We will define evaluation metrics that predict the quality of the transcription based on semantics rather than merely word error rate.
* Finally, we will contribute to the theoretical and methodological development of machine learning with sparse data.
